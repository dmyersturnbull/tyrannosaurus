# See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/ for how this works
# == A note about these default choices ==
# virtualenv 20.0.34 partly breaks pre-commit under conda
# https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/12094
# Poetry uses pip and setuptools (although they're not included as dependencies)
# We don't need to list wheel here, but setting a min vr can avoid generating inferior wheels
