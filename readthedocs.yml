# Using this requirements.txt is currently unavoidable
# This is because pip does not understand poetry's dev-dependencies
# To get pip to install the dependencies from pyproject.toml here,
# you would need to specify them in tool.poetry.dependencies.
# Unfortunately, this would mean they are duplicated between dependencies
# and dev-dependencies. It would also force Poetry to resolve those
# dependencies on install, even if they're marked with optional=true.
# This would decrease the end-user install performance.
# So, having an extra file is the only downside to this requirements.txt.
